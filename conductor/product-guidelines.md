# Product Guidelines — Mirai Asian Trading

## Brand Voice

### Tone

The brand voice is **authoritative, trustworthy, and refined**. Communication should feel like speaking with a seasoned private banker — knowledgeable without being condescending, confident without being aggressive.

| Attribute | Do | Don't |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Authoritative** | "Gold has historically served as a hedge against inflation" | "Gold is probably a good investment" |
| **Trustworthy** | "Every transaction is secured and documented" | "Trust us, we're the best" |
| **Refined** | "Explore our curated collection of investment-grade gold" | "Check out our awesome gold deals!" |
| **Approachable** | "Our advisors are ready to guide your first purchase" | "Contact us if you dare" |

### Language Register

- Use formal but accessible English. Avoid jargon unless defined.
- Filipino translations should use professional Tagalog, not colloquial.
- Japanese translations should use polite form (です/ます).

- Headlines use title case (Chicago style). Body text uses sentence case.
